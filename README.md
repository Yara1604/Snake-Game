# Snake-Game
A classic snake game 🐍 made using python turtle graphics!

This project was made along Dr. Angela Yu's course "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp" with an extra feature. 🌟

Modifications:
- Added a reset feature (by pressing 'r')
- Changed the theme

PS: Turtle graphics is a package that's included in the standard python library, so you don't need to install any package to run it.
